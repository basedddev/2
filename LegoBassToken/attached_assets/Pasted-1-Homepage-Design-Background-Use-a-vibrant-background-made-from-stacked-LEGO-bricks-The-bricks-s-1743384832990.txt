1. Homepage Design:
Background: Use a vibrant background made from stacked LEGO bricks. The bricks should be primarily yellow, blue, and green. The background should appear dynamic and playful, reminiscent of the classic LEGO aesthetic.

Main Feature: Display a prominent image of a LEGO Big Mouth Billy Bass model in the center of the homepage. The model should be as realistic as possible, made out of LEGO pieces. Make sure the fish's mouth appears animated, as if it’s ready to "sing" or "move."

Header: Include a catchy title like “The LEGO Big Mouth Billy Bass” with a fun, bold font. Beneath it, a subtitle can say: “Bringing fun and nostalgia together with LEGO bricks.”

Call to Action: Use a button that says, "Explore the LEGO Build" or "Start Your Journey," leading users to more detailed pages about the project.

2. Community Section (Vouch Tab):
Tab Name: Call this section “Community” or “Vouch.”

Design: Create a clean, simple interface for visitors to leave comments and testimonials. The background of this section can continue the LEGO brick theme but with a slightly more neutral color to make the text stand out.

Form Fields: Include a form where users can submit their testimonials. Fields should include:

Name (Optional)

Location (Optional)

Message (Text area for comments)

Display Testimonials: Below the form, display a scrollable feed of user-submitted testimonials. Each testimonial can appear in a LEGO-styled “frame,” to keep the theme consistent.

Vouch Button: Place a button like “Vouch for LEGO Big Mouth Billy Bass” which will submit the user’s testimonial. Optionally, you can also include a section where visitors can rate the build (like a 5-star system).

Interactive Element: To make the community feel more alive, consider a comment section where users can reply to each other’s vouches.

3. Additional Pages/Sections:
About Page: Create a section that tells the story of how the LEGO Big Mouth Billy Bass was conceived, designed, and built. Include interesting facts or behind-the-scenes content about the build.

Gallery Page: Showcase more detailed pictures of the LEGO Big Mouth Billy Bass, including close-up shots of the different LEGO pieces, colors, and design features.

How-to or Build Page: If possible, include a page that shows step-by-step instructions or videos on how to build the LEGO Big Mouth Billy Bass, including the list of pieces needed.

4. Other Functional Elements:
Navigation: Use a simple navigation bar at the top of the page with links to the following sections: Home, About, Community, Gallery, and How-to.

Footer: Include contact information, social media links, and credits for the LEGO designers (if applicable).

5. Interactive Features:
Animations: Use subtle animations on the homepage, such as the fish moving or the mouth opening and closing when hovered over. For example, the LEGO Big Mouth Billy Bass could "sing" or play a sound when a user clicks on it.

Hover Effects: When hovering over the LEGO pieces in the background, they could light up or change slightly to make the site more engaging.

6. Responsive Design:
Ensure that the site is mobile-friendly and responsive, with layouts that adjust to smaller screen sizes and touch gestures.

7. Color Palette & Typography:
Use bold, playful colors that match the LEGO aesthetic, primarily yellow, blue, and green.

For typography, choose a friendly, rounded sans-serif font (such as Comic Sans or something similar), to keep the tone lighthearted.
